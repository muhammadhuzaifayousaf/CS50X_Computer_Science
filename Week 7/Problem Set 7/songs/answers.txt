1. The listener's audio aura, based on their top 100 songs in 2018, could be characterized by calculating the average energy, valence, and danceability. If these averages are high, it suggests the listener prefers upbeat, happy, and danceable music. Conversely, lower averages may indicate a preference for calmer, more reflective, or sadder music.

2. This calculation might not be fully representative because it only provides an average, which could obscure the variety of songs the listener enjoys. Some listeners may enjoy both energetic and calm songs, but an average may not reflect this range. Additionally, the aura doesn’t consider how often the listener played each song, meaning that some songs might have a more significant impact than others.

3. A better way to calculate the aura could involve weighing songs by how often they were played, to better reflect the songs that were most meaningful to the listener. Additionally, clustering songs into mood categories (e.g., happy, sad, chill, etc.) could provide a more detailed analysis. Other factors like lyrics sentiment or the genres of the songs could also be considered to give a fuller picture of the listener’s mood preferences.
